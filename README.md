# Alice in Wonderland Trivia Game

This Trivia game project uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML. The game uses a 5 question multiple-choice trivia form and the player has 120 seconds to answer all five questions as displayed in the countdown timer at the top of the page. Players may not select more than one answer per question. 

The game ends when the time runs out or if the player fails to answer all of the questions. The page reveals the number of questions that the player answered correctly and incorrectly.
